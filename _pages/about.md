I'm Xiaoya Zhang, third year graduate student in [Department of Astronomy](https://DOAweb.com), Tsinghua Universiity, main interest in galactic astrophysics.

Currently I'm working on combining [MaNGA](https://test.com) IFU data with deeper photometric data such as [DeCALS](http://test.com) to study galactic properties.

previous projects: 
- radial distribution of dust attenuation in MaNGA sample.
- measuring SMBH mass kinematically.
